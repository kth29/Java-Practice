# Project 3: WellNet - Patient and Diagnosis Form Micro-Services

## Description

* The Patient service and Diagnosis Form service form the basis of nearly all patient-related functionalities.
* Patient service allows for the creation, deletion, and modification of patient data, including allergies and vaccinations. Creating allergies and vaccinations will register them within the hospital’s system. You can also display a list of patients.
* Diagnosis service allows for the creation, deletion, and modification of data related to a patient’s diagnosis and treatment. It is a way for doctors and nurses to keep track of checked-in patients.
